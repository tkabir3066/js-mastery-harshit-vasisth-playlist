//Basic Theory

//AJAX: Asynchronous javascript and and XML (but now HTTP Request)
// is a set of "web development techniques"
//using many web technologies on the "client-side"
//to create asynchronous web applications

// with AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve
//data from a server asynchronously(in the background)
//without interfering with the display and
// behavior of the existing page

//we don't use data in XML format anymore
//we use json now

//We have most 3 common ways to create and send request to server:-
// 1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2. fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3. axios(this is third party library)
